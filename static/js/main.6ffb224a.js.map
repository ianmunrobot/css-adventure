A TextMarker is a\n// handle that can be used to clear or find a marked position in the\n// document. Line objects hold arrays (markedSpans) containing\n// {from, to, marker} object pointing to such marker objects, and\n// indicating that such a marker is present on that line. Multiple\n// lines may point to the same marker when it spans across lines.\n// The spans will have null for their from/to properties when the\n// marker continues beyond the start/end of the line. Markers have\n// links back to the lines they currently touch.\n\n// Collapsed markers have unique ids, in order to be able to order\n// them, which is needed for uniquely determining an outer marker\n// when they overlap (they may nest, but not partially overlap).\nvar nextMarkerId = 0;\n\nvar TextMarker = function(doc, type) {\n  this.lines = [];\n  this.type = type;\n  this.doc = doc;\n  this.id = ++nextMarkerId;\n};\n\n// Clear the marker.\nTextMarker.prototype.clear = function () {\n    var this$1 = this;\n\n  if (this.explicitlyCleared) { return }\n  var cm = this.doc.cm, withOp = cm && !cm.curOp;\n  if (withOp) { startOperation(cm); }\n  if (hasHandler(this, \"clear\")) {\n    var found = this.find();\n    if (found) { signalLater(this, \"clear\", found.from, found.to); }\n  }\n  var min = null, max = null;\n  for (var i = 0; i < this.lines.length; ++i) {\n    var line = this$1.lines[i];\n    var span = getMarkedSpanFor(line.markedSpans, this$1);\n    if (cm && !this$1.collapsed) { regLineChange(cm, lineNo(line), \"text\"); }\n    else if (cm) {\n      if (span.to != null) { max = lineNo(line); }\n      if (span.from != null) { min = lineNo(line); }\n    }\n    line.markedSpans = removeMarkedSpan(line.markedSpans, span);\n    if (span.from == null && this$1.collapsed && !lineIsHidden(this$1.doc, line) && cm)\n      { updateLineHeight(line, textHeight(cm.display)); }\n  }\n  if (cm && this.collapsed && !cm.options.lineWrapping) { for (var i$1 = 0; i$1 < this.lines.length; ++i$1) {\n    var visual = visualLine(this$1.lines[i$1]), len = lineLength(visual);\n    if (len > cm.display.maxLineLength) {\n      cm.display.maxLine = visual;\n      cm.display.maxLineLength = len;\n      cm.display.maxLineChanged = true;\n    }\n  } }\n\n  if (min != null && cm && this.collapsed) { regChange(cm, min, max + 1); }\n  this.lines.length = 0;\n  this.explicitlyCleared = true;\n  if (this.atomic && this.doc.cantEdit) {\n    this.doc.cantEdit = false;\n    if (cm) { reCheckSelection(cm.doc); }\n  }\n  if (cm) { signalLater(cm, \"markerCleared\", cm, this, min, max); }\n  if (withOp) { endOperation(cm); }\n  if (this.parent) { this.parent.clear(); }\n};\n\n// Find the position of the marker in the document.
